☀️ Hello, Welcome to my page!

I'm a master's student at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/) specializing in sociology.I am a self-motivated student with a passion for digital sociology and computational social science.


Research Interests
======
I am interested in the digital transformation of daily life, online social interaction, and its theorization. 

Now I am focusing on the dynamics of online collectives, particularly the mechanisms linking micro and macro levels of analysis. My primary argument is that the online identity and self should be reconfigured in the context of collective action. The boundary between social interaction and collective action has blurred in social media, and the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action. 

I have already written a theoretical paper on the relationship between online collective action and the self (presented at The 9th Lilin Forum, CASS), as well as a study on digital vigilantism in China's online sphere (submitted to AEJMC 2024 Conference).

Currently, I am using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulations to validate my theoretical explanations collaborating with [FangYiKuang Ding](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zZtzLEEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AILGF5VfcWBlFxNDWbP35F-rxUwbniY918HvT8HKCT7EnftWJwJU1SiARyLcTL0epdyZRdbv9B0FwlRSfjN1gSwjGuOIcN_-WFpdjkDUadnPwsPFPPOEUmelq9Gf-e9fiqEmpt8ZjSwkXAQotnDTXHcwrxU6HknWd97UAA7B8GBrmKha12sMhIq9pl8). Simulation helps bridge the gap between micro and macro research perspectives. I am also interested in exploring the use of LLM in social simulation.

Theoretical Exploration of Dynamics of Online Collective Action
------

The interpretation of individuals acting in collectives in established research is often simplified by rational choice modeling, suspending the intrinsic dimensions of the individual and delineating a dichotomy between micro-mental processes and macro-actions and consequences. Returning to the common-sense meaning of the self, this paper argues that social media has enabled a deviation between action and the formation of identity. In digital action, the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action, thus providing an explanatory framework for online interactions and the self.

The article proposes a mechanism that combines graph theory (the power-law distribution of information on the internet) and empirical research from social psychology on self. The concept of self-integration relates to the narrative self. I proposed this concept in another paper.

This article first constructs the concepts and theoretical hypotheses, proposing mechanisms that my collaborator formalizes mathematically. Finally, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) and real-case data from networks for validation and calibration.

This work can be referenced in the [draft](files/draft of text accumulation.pdf).


Empirical Research of Online Collective Action
------

I am particularly interested in feminist movements online and the polarization of gender discourse. Therefore, I first conducted a case study on the recent trend of gender antagonism online. Regarding self-identity and the evolution of actions on the internet, digital activism and digital nationalism have both been extensively discussed. 

**Trolls and Polarization: Gender Antagonism on social media**

I first conducted a case study on the recent trend of gender antagonism online. In one case, a couple was believed to have faced a situation where the woman deceived the man, leading to the man's suicide. This incident aroused anger and victim paranoia among a largely male group online, sparking a wave of misogynistic comments on the Chinese internet. I am currently scraping relevant data to refine my theory further.


**Digital Nationalism and Vigilantism: Insulting China**

At the same time, there is another prominent media phenomenon on the Chinese internet: an increasing number of events are reported as insults to China. My colleagues and I wish to explore the underlying reasons behind this, adopting the perspective of digital vigilantes. 

In China, mainstream values are predominant. Therefore, discussions about insults to China often become one-sided attacks on other people or brands, turning into a form of vigilantism. I hope to contrast this case with feminist research to understand the differences in opinion evolution trends brought about by different values and authoritative knowledge types on the internet.

Insulting China has been a viral term on social media. One of the controversies pointed out the term is being generalized - manifested in the expansion of the context use and indiscriminate targeting of the attack. This study attempts to employ a social physics model called “shockwave” to provide a mechanistic explanation. Broadly we investigate how an individual’s everyday nationalism decisions evolve into collective actions. Digital vigilantism theory and digital nationalism pictured that nationalists’ mediated “policing” (everyday censorship, struggle, and decision) driven by identity and justice/moral concern to the mediated “denunciation”, and then, within the conditions of mediated visibility to evolve as a societal-level phenomenon. We test the research hypothesis and compare the simulation results with the historical event data.

Our research on insults to China involves collecting data on incidents reported and evaluated as insults over the past four years and creating a publicly accessible database of these events. I plan to *release this data in about a month, publish it on GitHub, and synchronize it on my personal website*.


Academic Journey
======

My research is not entirely within computational communication or political communication. I intend to continue studying the various ideologies and structures of authority related to these topics, understanding how they interact with algorithms and the relationship between online opinions and real-world social beliefs and knowledge changes.

In my early research, I concentrated on the impact of ICT and software as infrastructure on daily life and government governance, primarily adopting perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS). This involved examining the tensions and changing relationships between technology and everyday life.

To bridge the relationship between micro-level interactions and macro-level societal consequences, I explored Computational Social Science (CSS) methods and began writing theoretical articles on the changing nature of subjects within internet interactions, delving into digital activism. Driven by an interest in the nature of media itself, I also engaged in projects related to algorithm design and participated in research on internet platforms and platform labor.


Original Question: The Digital Transformation of Daily Life
------

Initially, I was most concerned about the tension between the introduction of digital technology and the logic of daily life. How do they differ? How does digital technology transform people through design, shaping new forms of social interaction and social knowledge? In other words, my initial question was how change happens, how significant transformations affect everyone, and how digital logic interacts with people's living habits. Does digital technology bring new forms of social interaction? Driven by these rough questions and dissatisfaction, I shifted to my current research direction, writing about the changes in "self" in the digital age, especially how it causes a disconnection between social action and self, making digital actions significant social actions that cannot be explained by traditional sociology. 

**The Digital Transformation of Interpersonal Relationships in Rural Areas**

This research primarily employs qualitative methods, including unstructured interviews and participatory observation, conducting fieldwork in one or two villages. Initially, the goal was to examine the digital usage among local people, but it later shifted to the tension between daily life logic and digital technology. This tension is particularly evident in the promotion of digital technologies by grassroots governments, which often diverges from the actual needs of the people. Successful government projects sometimes employ coercion or create new demands to transform technology into a social process (as discussed in the social policy paper). In other cases, sudden events, such as the implementation of health codes, are utilized. This research was further advanced through studies in more developed provinces and cities.

Commercial apps, due to their high degree of customization, are widely and diversely used by the public. Each app has its own audience, and everyone's mobile phone usage is highly personalized. For instance, a woman might use video or audio players more frequently, listening to them as background noise while doing household chores. This observation sparked my interest in hyperconnectivity, as discussed in Brubaker's works, and related books by Sherry Turkle, leading to some insights.

**The Digital Transformation of Local Governance and Why People Accept It**

Insulting China has been a viral term on social media. One of the controversies pointed out the term is being generalization - manifested in the expansion of the context use and indiscriminate targeting of the attack. This study attempts to employ a social physics model called “shockwave” to provide a mechanistic explanation.
