☀️ Hello!
I'm a master's student at [East China University of Science and Technology](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/) specializing in sociology. My current research interests center around digital sociology and computational social science.


Research Interests
======
I am interested in the digital transformation of daily life, online social interaction, and its theorization. 

Now I am focusing on the dynamics of online collectives, particularly the mechanisms linking micro and macro levels of analysis. My primary argument is that the online identity and self should be reconfigured in the context of collective action. The boundary between social interaction and collective action has blurred in social media, and the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action. There is a demand for theorizing the form of online behavior.

I have already written a theoretical paper on the relationship between online collective action and the self (presented at The 9th Lilin Forum, CASS), as well as a study on digital vigilantism in China's online sphere (submitted to AEJMC 2024 Conference).

Currently, I am using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) simulations to validate my theoretical explanations collaborating with [FangYiKuang Ding](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zZtzLEEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AILGF5VfcWBlFxNDWbP35F-rxUwbniY918HvT8HKCT7EnftWJwJU1SiARyLcTL0epdyZRdbv9B0FwlRSfjN1gSwjGuOIcN_-WFpdjkDUadnPwsPFPPOEUmelq9Gf-e9fiqEmpt8ZjSwkXAQotnDTXHcwrxU6HknWd97UAA7B8GBrmKha12sMhIq9pl8). Simulation helps bridge the gap between micro and macro research perspectives. I am also interested in exploring the use of LLM in social simulation.



Research Experiences
======

Specifically, my research focuses on understanding (1) how people make decisions on media selection? (2) how a technology-shaped environment functions, where the environment is regarded as a market-based situation: demand, supply, and currency(“attention”) (3) how political power is engaged in the “mediatization” process(e.g. by social curation and circulation) and its unexpected consequence.

Theoretical Exploration of Dynamics of Online Collective Action
------

The interpretation of individuals acting in collectives in established research is often simplified by rational choice modeling, suspending the intrinsic dimensions of the individual and delineating a dichotomy between micro-mental processes and macro-actions and consequences. Returning to the common-sense meaning of the self, this paper argues that social media has enabled a deviation between action and the formation of identity. In digital action, the degree of self-integration of actors takes on an indeterminate character, which in turn explains the form of online collective action, thus providing an explanatory framework for online interactions and the self.



Empirical Research of Online Collective Action

**Digital Nationalism and Vigilantism: Insulting China**

Insulting China has been a viral term on social media. One of the controversies pointed out the term is being generalization - manifested in the expansion of the context use and indiscriminate targeting of the attack. This study attempts to employ a social physics model called “shockwave” to provide a mechanistic explanation. Broadly we investigate how an individual’s everyday nationalism decisions evolve into collective actions. Digital vigilantism theory and digital nationalism pictured that nationalists’ mediated “policing” (everyday censorship, struggle, and decision) driven by identity and justice/moral concern to the mediated “denunciation”, and then, within the conditions of mediated visibility to evolve as a societal-level phenomenon. We test the research hypothesis and compare the simulation results with the historical event data.

Relevant Programs

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Academic Journey
======

Motivation
------

In my early research, I concentrated on the impact of ICT and software as infrastructure on daily life and government governance, primarily adopting perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS). This involved examining the tensions and changing relationships between technology and everyday life.

To bridge the relationship between micro-level interactions and macro-level societal consequences, I explored Computational Social Science (CSS) methods and began writing theoretical articles on the changing nature of subjects within internet interactions, delving into digital activism. Driven by an interest in the nature of media itself, I also engaged in projects related to algorithm design and participated in research on internet platforms and platform labor.

Since I 

**Reading**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
