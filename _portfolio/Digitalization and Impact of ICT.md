This series of studies concentrated on the inequity of the impact on different conditions. I have condensed some of my experiences in my CV and I will cover them in detail on this page.

## Regional Differences in the Impact of Digital Information Valuation on Urban and Rural Income Equity

I Utilized cross-sectional data from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies(N=7140)and applied a moderating effect model based on Grant and Sumanth's three-way interactions by Stata.
This paper combines quantitative research methods with spatial analysis to explore the impact of individual usage and valuation of digital information on income at
the micro level, and examines the differences in this impact across urban, rural, and geographical locations. The study posits that (1) there is a significant positive correlation
between the importance placed on information technology and residents' income; (2)
urban and rural contexts negatively moderate the impact of information technology
valuation on residents' income; (3) the moderating effect of urban and rural contexts on
the impact of information technology valuation on residents' income varies by
geographical location. Given China's vast territory and significant regional differences, this paper presents a spatial visualization of the urban-rural differences in the impact of
digital dividends based on statistical data.
