This series of studies concentrated on the inequity of the impact of ICT on different conditions. I have condensed some of my experiences in my CV and I will cover them in detail on this page.

## Regional Differences in the Impact of Digital Information Valuation on Urban and Rural Income Equity

I Utilized cross-sectional data from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies(N=7140)and applied a moderating effect model based on Grant and Sumanth's three-way interactions by Stata.
This paper combines quantitative research methods with spatial analysis to explore the impact of individual usage and valuation of digital information on income at
the micro level, and examines the differences in this impact across urban, rural, and geographical locations. The study posits that (1) there is a significant positive correlation
between the importance placed on information technology and residents' income; (2)
urban and rural contexts negatively moderate the impact of information technology
valuation on residents' income; (3) the moderating effect of urban and rural contexts on
the impact of information technology valuation on residents' income varies by
geographical location. Given China's vast territory and significant regional differences, this paper presents a spatial visualization of the urban-rural differences in the impact of
digital dividends based on statistical data.

## Characteristics of Platform Workers

This study conducted a survey(N=1354) of new employment groups, including various types of digital workers in China, ranging from Uber drivers(in China, it's called DIDI drivers) and food delivery workers to internet technology professionals. I performed a cross-analysis of the data.

## User Habits and Video Production on TikTok

This study is a project of the National Philosophy and Social Science Project for Young Scholars, Item No.23CSH084.

In this study, I was involved in designing the interview outline and conducting interviews with both TikTok users and TikTok video creators. In the subsequent research, additional interviews were conducted with the new media departments of platform companies.


## Research on Home Service Platform Companies in Shanghai

This research is funded by the Shanghai government.

As a research assistant, I participated in the entire survey process, which included roundtable discussions with business operators, interviews with frontline workers, and interviews with middle management. I also handled policy documents and materials from industry associations.

In the home service industry, there is a strong gender division of labor, with the majority of workers being women. Despite being well-paid, the industry faces persistent discrimination. 

Workers in this sector experience high turnover, and female workers often choose to return home to be housewives during traditional holidays and significant stages of their children's lives. In China, it is very common for women to balance both motherhood and external employment. Due to industry discrimination, a significant number of workers are women from the lower social strata.
