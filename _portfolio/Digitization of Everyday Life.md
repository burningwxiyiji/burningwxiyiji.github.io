This series of studies shows my initial concern.

## The Digital Transformation of Interpersonal Relationships in Rural Areas

This is my first personal project. 

I applied for this project and successfully secured a 10,000 RMB grant from Hunan Province(Item No.S202010530040) as the project leader. I designed the research and conducted fieldwork in multiple villages and towns in rural areas for about a month.

The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, starting with participatory observation and unstructured interviews. Subsequently, we designed a questionnaire for descriptive statistics and selected two villages and towns for ongoing research and in-depth interviews.

The study found that in mountainous villages, people constructed online group chats based on their geographic locations. Even those who had bought houses elsewhere continued to participate in group chats according to their original residential locations, acting as political representatives and sponsors of collective development.

The research later shifted my focus toward the role of media in spatiality.

## Local Practice and Organizational Logic of Digitalization of Grassroots Governance

In this study, I refined my research question to focus on how centrally promoted digital technologies are functioning in grassroots governance in remote areas where local knowledge is traditionally used to solve problems. This partially addresses the question: How does technology change everyday life?
